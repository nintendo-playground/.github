**This is an unofficial organization. I am in no way affiliated with Nintendo.**

This organization hosts the source code of various services behind https://nintendo-playground.com.

### Goals
The playground lets you test custom client implementations without contacting Nintendo's servers. This can be useful because invalid requests can easily get your device banned, and buying a new one is expensive.

Here are some examples that show why custom clients can be useful:
* https://splatoon.oatmealdome.me/
* https://www.mkdatabase.com/

I also wanted to practice with web technology (see [infrastructure](https://github.com/nintendo-playground/.github/blob/main/profile/infrastructure.md)).

### Repositories
* [Home page](https://github.com/nintendo-playground/home-page)
* [Device authentication server](https://github.com/nintendo-playground/dauth-server)
* [Application authentication server](https://github.com/nintendo-playground/aauth-server)
